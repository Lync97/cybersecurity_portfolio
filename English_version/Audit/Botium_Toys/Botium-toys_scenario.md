# Scenario

This scenario is based on a fictitious company:

**Botium Toys** is a small American company that develops and sells toys. The company has only one physical location. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers in the United States and abroad. Its IT department is under increasing pressure to support its online marketplace worldwide.

The IT manager has decided that an internal IT audit should be conducted. She is concerned about the company's lack of a solid action plan to ensure business continuity and compliance as it grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company's infrastructure and help identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical resources. The manager also wants to ensure the company is complying with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (EU).

The IT manager begins by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology **Cybersecurity Framework** (NIST CSF), defining the audit scope and objectives, and conducting a risk assessment. The objective of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company may face due to its current security posture. The IT manager wants to use the audit results as evidence to obtain approval to expand her service.

Your task is to review the IT manager's scope, objectives, and risk assessment. Then, conduct an internal audit to complement the control assessment and compliance checklist.
