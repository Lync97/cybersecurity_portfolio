# 🛠️ Project Initializer Script

This project includes two Bash scripts designed to **automate the creation and cleanup of a structured Linux environment** for a technical team. It demonstrates essential system administration skills such as user and group management, file structure organization, access control, and archiving.

---

## 📂 Scripts

### ✅ `project_initializer.sh`

This script creates a simulated project workspace with multiple team folders, users, and secure permissions.

#### 🔧 What it does:
1. **Displays a welcome message** with the current user and timestamp.
2. **Creates a project structure**:
projects/
├── admin_team/
├── security_team/
└── users_team/
├── Gabens/
├── Don/
├── Danirode/
├── Lyncold/
└── history_command
3. **Creates a system user** `apm` and assigns it to the `admin_team` group.
4. **Logs the command history** into `history_command`, and assigns ownership to `apm`.
5. **Restricts access** to `admin_team` and `security_team` folders for non-owners.
6. **Archives the entire project** as `projects.tar.gz`.

#### 🧠 Skills demonstrated:
- Linux user and group administration
- Permission and ownership management
- Script automation with Bash
- Secure file structure design
- Archiving and packaging with `tar`

### 🧹 `remove_project_initializer.sh`

This companion script **cleans up** everything created by the initializer script.

#### 🔧 What it does:
- Deletes the user `apm`  
- Deletes the group `admin_team`  
- Removes the `projects` folder and the `projects.tar.gz` archive

```bash
#!/bin/bash

sudo userdel apm
sudo groupdel admin_team
sudo rm -rf /home/apm projects projects.tar.gz
